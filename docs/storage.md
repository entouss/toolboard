# Storage

All data is board-scoped via `boardKey(key)` → `finance_${currentBoardId}_${key}` localStorage keys.

## Key Storage Types

- `positions` — tool x/y/z/width/height
- `toolCustomizations` — per-tool state
- `customTools` — user-created tools
- `hiddenTools` — tools hidden from the board
- `toolboardSettings` — board-level settings (title, color)
- `variables` — user-defined variables

## Tool-Specific Data

Tool-specific data is stored as a named property inside `toolCustomizations[toolId]` (e.g., `checklistItems`, `dirtreeItems`, `diffData`).

## Helpers

- `loadToolCustomizations()` — reads the full customizations object from localStorage
- `saveToolCustomizations(customizations)` — writes the full customizations object to localStorage
