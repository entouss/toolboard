Think about what we learned during the session. Focus on session memory analysis and minimal file reading to avoid LLM context window overflow. read the documentation, and refine things that you have learned during this session.

Create a todo list to track the refining process:

- Run `find docs/ -name "*.md" | sort` to see available docs.
- Read documentation on how to write documentation.
- Create todo items for new knowledge and guidelines we discovered
